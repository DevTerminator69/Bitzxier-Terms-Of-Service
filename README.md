For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

By using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you, and you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to the owner of Bitzxier.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. We may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate use of it at any time by giving notice of termination to you.

Restrictions on your use of Bitzxier's services:

Bitzxier allows you to send messages into Discord channels without being able to clearly determine the responsible person for each message; therefore, the owner of a Discord server is liable for messages or actions taken by the bot.

You may not:

- Send advertisements of any kind using Bitzxier's message system.

- Make the server from which a direct message was sent unrecognizable. 

- Bitzxier always includes the server from which a direct message was sent to ensure that users can keep track of which servers are sending messages to them. Thus, you must ensure that every direct message you send using Bitzxier is clearly identifiable as a message from your server.
- Repeatedly send messages in a short time span, especially not via direct message.
- Use Bitzxier on servers that violate Discord's Community Guidelines or use Bitzxier in a manner that contravenes them.

- Trick, defraud, or mislead us and other users, especially in any attempt to learn sensitive account information such as user passwords.
- Make improper use of our support services or submit false reports of abuse or misconduct.
- Engage in unauthorized framing of or linking to the website.
- Attempt to bypass any measures of the Bot designed to prevent or restrict access to the Bot or any portion of the Bot.
- Use any type of unauthorized automation within Discord.

**Note**

Breaking any of the following will lead to blacklisting and banning from our services.
